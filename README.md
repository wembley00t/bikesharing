# Bike Sharing Data Project

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project is to use bike sharing data from NYC and create data visualization results to determine if a bike sharing program is a feasible project in Des Moines Iowa.

## Results of Analysis

Tableau was used to create visualizations of the data.  Below are seven of the visualizations used to review the data.


The line graph displays the number of bikes checked out by duration by all users.  The graph can be filtered by the hour. The visualization of the checkout times shows that most bikes are used for less than an hour.

The line graphy displays the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour.  The graph can be filterd by the hour and by gender.  The checkout times by gender support the overall checkout times for all users.  The majority of users are male but all genders show trips are generally less than an hour.

The heatmap below shows the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week.  Overall trips by weekday show the heaviest usage on Thursdays at 8am and 5pm/6pm corresponding with the beginning and end of the work day.

The heatmap below shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of the day.  The heatmap can be filtered by gender.  Trips by gender support the overall trip data.  Males are the majority users with the heaviest usage time on Thursdays at 8am and 5pm/6pm.

The heatmap below shows the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.  The graph can be filtered by type of user and gender.  Trips by gender by weekday show the heaviest use day is by males that are subscribers on Thursday.  For all users, the end of the week shows higher usage than the beginning.

Customer type shows that 81% of the users are subscribers.

The gender breakdown shows that 65% of the users are male compared to 25% female and the remainder unknown.

## Summary 

The NYC data results tend to indicate there is a solid business for bike sharing by subscribers in a metropolitan area.  The population for Des Moines should be compared to understand the male/female ratio as well as the number of people working in the metro area.  Two additional visualizations for future analysis would be to highlight revenue and profit generated in addition to the repair costs for the bikes.  An additional visualization would be to review bikes used vs bikes returned to understand if "lost" bikes are an issue.
